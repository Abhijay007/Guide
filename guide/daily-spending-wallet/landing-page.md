# Daily spending wallet

This section is an in-depth design exploration of a bitcoin wallet for on-the-go payments. It focuses are on:

- Bitcoin-only
- Non-custodial
- Mobile
- Lightning first

Imagine a product which tries to solve the problem of quickly and easily sending smaller amounts of money to friends and family, or paying for [small purchases]({{ '/guide/designing-products/personal-finance/#day-to-day-spending' | relative_url }}). Ease and speed of use will be important as usage is likely to be on mobile devices and on the go. Users are not expected to be well-versed in bitcoin technology or advanced private key management, making it reasonable to worry more about self-inflicted loss than theft.
